# What is Dopamine?
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which plays a role in your motivation, drive, and excitement towards something. Dopamine exists within us maintained at a baseline level, with various events in our day-to-day life causing peaks in dopamine level.

# Managing our Dopamine Levels
For us to then manage our dopamine levels, it's necessary that we do our best to avoid participating in events that cause a substantial peak in dopamine levels. These types of events which cause substantial peaks result in sharp drops in dopamine below the baseline, hence why having to study or do chores is more difficult after something like scrolling social media.
